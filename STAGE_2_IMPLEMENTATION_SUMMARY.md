# Stage 2 Implementation Summary
**Multi-Project Dashboard - Real Functionality**

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - All acceptance criteria met

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented **Stage 2 - Real Functionality** of the Multi-Project Dashboard PRD using **Next.js Server Actions** (no API routes needed). The dashboard now provides full project CRUD operations, localStorage persistence, integration with all existing features (Idea Capture, Assumption Challenger, Experiment Canvas), and real-time activity tracking.

---

## 1. What Was Built

### 1.1 Core Dashboard Pages

**New Routes:**
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard with project grid view
- `/dashboard/[id]` - Project detail page with tabs

### 1.2 Server Actions (Preferred over API Routes)

Created **`/src/app/dashboard/actions.ts`** with the following Server Actions:

```typescript
✅ createProject(input: CreateProjectInput)
✅ updateProject(input: UpdateProjectInput)
✅ deleteProject(projectId: string)
✅ logProjectActivity(projectId, type, description, metadata)
✅ linkItemToProject(projectId, itemType, itemId, itemTitle)
✅ calculateDashboardStats(projects, ideas, experiments)
✅ validateProjectName(name, existingProjects, excludeId?)
```

**Why Server Actions?**
- No external services need to call our app over HTTP
- Simpler than API routes for this use case
- Better type safety with direct function imports
- Built-in CSRF protection

### 1.3 UI Components

**New Dashboard Components:**
- `@src/components/dashboard/project-card.tsx` - Individual project card with status badges, tags, timestamps
- `@src/components/dashboard/project-form-modal.tsx` - Create/edit project modal with validation
- `@src/components/dashboard/delete-confirm-dialog.tsx` - Confirmation dialog for destructive actions

### 1.4 Data Schema

**Project Interface:**
```typescript
interface Project {
  id: string;
  name: string;              // Max 60 chars
  description: string;       // Max 300 chars
  status: 'Active' | 'Stalled' | 'Validated' | 'Idea';
  tags: string[];
  createdAt: string;         // ISO timestamp
  updatedAt: string;         // ISO timestamp
}
```

**Activity Interface:**
```typescript
interface ProjectActivity {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  type: 'project_created' | 'idea_added' | 'assumption_challenged' | 
        'experiment_generated' | 'status_changed' | 'project_updated';
  description: string;
  timestamp: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

**localStorage Keys:**
- `dashboard-projects` - Array of Project objects
- `project-activity` - Array of ProjectActivity objects
- `captured-ideas` - Extended with `projectId` and `projectName` fields
- `challenge-history` - Extended with `projectId` and `projectName` fields
- `canvas-history` - Extended with `projectId` and `projectName` fields

## 6. Technical Implementation Details

### 6.1 Data Flow

**Creating a Project:**
1. User fills form in ProjectFormModal
2. Client calls `createProject()` Server Action
3. Server Action validates input and returns Project object
4. Client saves to localStorage and updates state
5. Dashboard re-renders with new project

**Linking an Idea to a Project:**
1. User clicks "Add Idea" from project detail page
2. Navigates to `/idea-capture?projectId=...&projectName=...`
3. Idea Capture page reads URL params and displays banner
4. When idea is saved:
   - Saves to `captured-ideas` with `projectId` field
   - Creates activity entry in `project-activity`
5. Activity appears in project timeline immediately

**Viewing Project Details:**
1. User clicks project card
2. Navigates to `/dashboard/[id]`
3. Page loads all data from localStorage:
   - Project details from `dashboard-projects`
   - Activities from `project-activity`
   - Linked ideas from `captured-ideas` (filtered by projectId)
   - Linked assumptions from `challenge-history` (filtered by projectId)
   - Linked experiments from `canvas-history` (filtered by projectId)
4. Displays in tabbed interface

### 6.2 localStorage Strategy

**Why localStorage for Stage 2?**
- ✅ No database setup required for MVP validation
- ✅ Fast prototyping and iteration
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Easy to inspect/debug
- ✅ Validates UX before adding backend complexity

**Migration Path to Stage 3:**
When ready to add database persistence:
1. Create Supabase/Postgres tables matching interfaces
2. Replace localStorage calls with database queries
3. Add API routes for external access
4. Keep Server Actions as abstraction layer
5. Add user authentication

### 6.3 Type Safety

All components and Server Actions use TypeScript interfaces:
- `Project` - Core project data
- `ProjectActivity` - Activity timeline entries
- `CreateProjectInput` - Create action params
- `UpdateProjectInput` - Update action params
- `DashboardStats` - Stats calculation return type
