└── generate-canvas/route.ts    # Experiment canvas generation
```

### Components (Client-Side)
```
src/components/
├── idea-capture.tsx           # Feature 1
├── assumption-challenger.tsx  # Feature 2
└── experiment-canvas.tsx      # Feature 3
```

### Pages
```
src/app/
├── idea-capture/page.tsx
├── assumption-challenger/page.tsx
├── experiment-canvas/page.tsx
└── page.tsx (updated with feature cards)
```

### Documentation
```
src/docs/
├── concept.md                                      # Original product concept
├── idea-capture-tag-suggester-concept.md          # Feature 1 spec

## 🎯 Design Decisions

### No Database by Design
- All features use browser localStorage for persistence
- Enables immediate deployment without infrastructure
- Perfect for MVP validation
- Easy migration path to database later

### AI Integration Strategy
- Server-side API routes protect API keys
- Fallback responses if OpenAI unavailable
- GPT-3.5-turbo for simple tasks (tags)
- GPT-4 for complex reasoning (challenges, canvas)
- Structured JSON outputs for reliability

### User Experience Patterns
- Consistent flow: Input → Generate → Edit → Save/Export
- History panels for all features (optional persistence)
- Copy and download capabilities
- Inline editing for all AI-generated content
- Loading states and error handling
- Mobile-responsive design

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local file
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env.local
   ```

3. **Run development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access features:**
   - Homepage: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Idea Capture: `http://localhost:3000/idea-capture`
   - Assumption Challenger: `http://localhost:3000/assumption-challenger`
   - Experiment Canvas: `http://localhost:3000/experiment-canvas`

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

- **Consistent branding:** Each feature has unique icon and color accent
- **Progressive disclosure:** Features reveal complexity gradually
- **Immediate feedback:** Loading states, success animations
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** Enter key support where appropriate
- **Accessibility:** Proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML
- **Dark mode:** Full support via theme provider

## 📈 Success Metrics to Track (Future)

Once deployed, consider tracking:
1. Feature usage rates (which feature founders use most)
2. Ideas/challenges/canvases generated per session
3. Time spent on each feature
4. Copy/download actions (intent to use externally)
5. Return visits and history panel usage
