   ```

   Then edit `.env.local` and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**:
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

```

## 💡 Implementation Notes

### No Database Required

All three features work without a database:

- Data stored in browser `localStorage` for persistence across sessions
- API routes are stateless (generate on-demand)
- History tracking optional and client-side only

### AI Integration

- Uses OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo for tags, GPT-4 for challenges & canvas)
- Fallback responses if API fails or key is missing
- All AI calls are server-side (Next.js API routes)

### User Experience

- Inline editing for all generated content
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Download as Markdown (experiment canvas)
- History panels for recent activity
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

## 🔐 API Key Security

**Important**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. The `.gitignore` is already configured to exclude it.

If you don't have an OpenAI API key:

1. Features will use fallback responses
2. They'll still work but with generic output
3. Consider getting a key for best experience

## 🧪 Testing the Features

### Feature 1: Idea Capture & AI Tag Suggester

1. Navigate to `/idea-capture`
2. Paste an idea: "Add a referral program that gives both parties 20% off"
3. Click "Generate Tags"
4. Review suggested tags and customize as needed
5. Save and see it in your history

### Feature 2: AI Assumption Challenger

1. Navigate to `/assumption-challenger`
2. Enter: "I want to build a marketplace for freelance AI consultants with 15% commission"
3. Click "Challenge My Thinking"
4. Review the critical questions generated
5. Copy or review history

### Feature 3: Quick Experiment Canvas

1. Navigate to `/experiment-canvas`
2. Describe: "Test if a 7-day free trial with no credit card increases SaaS conversions"
3. Click "Generate Experiment Canvas"
4. Edit any field inline
5. Download as Markdown or copy to clipboard

## 📖 Documentation

Each feature has a detailed concept document in `src/docs/` explaining:

- What users can do
- Why it delivers value
- Implementation approach
- What's out of scope

## 🚧 What's NOT Included (By Design)

These features intentionally exclude:

- User authentication / accounts
- Backend database or persistence layer
- Cross-device synchronization
- Team collaboration features
- External integrations (Notion, Slack, etc.)
- Payment or subscription systems

This keeps the MVP focused on **validating core value** before adding complexity.

## 🎨 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **AI**: OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo & GPT-4)
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Language**: TypeScript

## 📝 Next Steps

After testing these features, consider:

1. Gathering user feedback on which feature provides most value
2. Adding analytics to track feature usage
3. Implementing database persistence for cross-device access
4. Building onboarding flow
5. Adding user authentication
