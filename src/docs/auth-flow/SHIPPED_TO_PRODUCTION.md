## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Technical Insights

1. **JWT Refresh Pattern:** Critical for onboarding - must force refresh after metadata update
2. **Middleware Placement:** Must be in `src/middleware.ts` for Next.js to detect
3. **RLS Policy Pattern:** `auth.jwt()->>'sub'` is the correct pattern for Clerk
4. **Environment Variables:** Relative paths work across all environments

### Process Insights

1. **Structured Planning:** 7-stage plan made implementation manageable
2. **Documentation First:** Guides at each stage maintained clarity
3. **Security Early:** RLS policies and secret management prevented issues
4. **Testing Approach:** Code review and static analysis caught issues early

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Social Login:** Add Google/GitHub OAuth
2. **Password Reset:** Custom password reset flow
3. **MFA:** Multi-factor authentication
4. **User Profile:** Profile editing pages
5. **Advanced Onboarding:** Custom fields and data collection
6. **Analytics:** Track onboarding completion rates

**All current limitations are documented and acceptable for initial release.**
