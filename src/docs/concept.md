# Multi-Project Dashboard with AI Strategy Partner

## Concept Summary

### 1. The Problem: Juggling Multiple Bets Without a Clear View

Solo founders of pre-product-market fit startups must simultaneously pursue multiple high-stakes initiatives—product experiments, marketing tests, sales outreach, and fundraising efforts. Their current approach is chaotic: scattered ideas across notes apps, browser tabs, and message threads, with no unified view of what's in motion, what's stalled, or what actually deserves attention.

Existing project management tools are built for teams executing known work, not solo founders exploring uncertain hypotheses. They lack the strategic intelligence to help founders make critical portfolio decisions: Which experiments should I prioritize? Are these initiatives conflicting or synergistic? What assumptions am I betting on that might be wrong?

As a result, founders spread themselves too thin, lose sight of promising experiments, double down on the wrong initiatives, and waste precious runway on unfocused execution—directly threatening their ability to find product-market fit before running out of time and capital.

### 2. Target Audience: The Overburdened Solo Founder

The primary target user is the **solo founder of a pre-product-market fit startup (typically with fewer than 10 employees)**.

This segment feels the pain most acutely. For them, every active project represents a bet with existential stakes. They're responsible for everything, are severely time-constrained, and need a strategic overview—not just task tracking. They have the authority and urgency to adopt a solution that helps them make smarter portfolio decisions and focus their limited energy on the highest-impact work.

### 3. The Solution: A Multi-Project Dashboard with AI Strategy Intelligence

We will build a **multi-project dashboard powered by an AI strategy partner** that helps solo founders visualize, analyze, and optimize their portfolio of initiatives.

This is not another Kanban board or task manager; it's a **strategic command center** that gives founders a unified view of all their active experiments, ideas, and initiatives. The AI acts as a sparring partner, providing portfolio-level intelligence: identifying conflicting assumptions, surfacing resource conflicts, recommending prioritization, and challenging weak hypotheses across all projects simultaneously.

### 4. Core User Experience & Key Features

The dashboard provides a visual portfolio view with AI-powered strategic guidance at both the project and portfolio level.

#### 4.1 Visual Project Portfolio (The Command Center)

Founders see all their active initiatives at a glance as project cards on a dashboard. Each card shows: project name, status (idea/active/stalled/validated), tags (e.g., `Growth Hack`, `Product Bet`, `Fundraising`), and last activity. The dashboard becomes the single source of truth for "what am I working on?"

#### 4.2 AI Project Health Scanner (The Triage Assistant)

The AI analyzes each project and provides real-time health signals: "This experiment has been stalled for 3 weeks," "This hypothesis conflicts with Project B," "Ready to test—next steps identified." Founders can quickly triage their portfolio and decide where to focus energy.

#### 4.3 Cross-Project Strategy Analysis (The Portfolio Strategist)

This is the core differentiation. The AI doesn't just analyze projects in isolation—it looks across the entire portfolio to identify:

- **Conflicting assumptions:** "Project A assumes users want speed; Project B assumes they want depth."
- **Resource conflicts:** "These 3 projects all require design work—which is most critical?"
- **Strategic synergies:** "Projects C and D could be combined into one higher-leverage experiment."
- **Prioritization recommendations:** "Based on your runway and learning goals, focus on Projects A and E."

#### 4.4 Per-Project AI Sparring (The Assumption Challenger)

Founders can drill into any project card and engage in AI-powered dialogue to challenge assumptions, generate experiment canvases, brainstorm next steps, or surface risks—all within the context of that specific initiative.

#### 4.5 Smart Capture & Auto-Organization (The Idea Inbox)

New ideas land in an inbox and the AI suggests which existing project they relate to or whether they should become new cards. Auto-tagging and clustering prevent the dashboard from becoming overwhelming as the founder's thinking evolves.

### 5. Unique Value Proposition

While other tools help you _track_ projects, our dashboard helps you _think strategically about your portfolio_. Its unique value lies in **portfolio-level AI intelligence**—no other tool helps founders understand the relationships, conflicts, and synergies across their initiatives. It's designed for the messy, uncertain, multi-threaded reality of early-stage solo founders, not for teams executing known roadmaps.

### 6. Desired Impact

By using this dashboard, solo founders will:

- **Stop spreading too thin:** See their full portfolio and make conscious choices about where to focus.
- **Avoid conflicting bets:** Surface hidden assumption conflicts before wasting time.
- **Increase experiment velocity:** Triage stalled projects and double down on high-signal initiatives.
- **Feel strategically in control:** Have a trusted AI partner helping them make portfolio decisions, not just task decisions.

In short, the solution transforms founders from reactive jugglers into strategic portfolio managers—spending less energy on coordination and more on shipping high-leverage experiments that accelerate their path to product-market fit.
