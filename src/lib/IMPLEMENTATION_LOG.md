## Environment Setup Required

Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Tests to Run
- [ ] Navigate to `/project-health-scanner`
- [ ] Try submitting with <3 projects (should show validation error)
- [ ] Submit with 3 valid projects
- [ ] Verify results display within 10 seconds
- [ ] Test "Copy All" button
- [ ] Test "Start Over" button
- [ ] Test mobile responsive layout
- [ ] Test dark mode
- [ ] Test without OPENAI_API_KEY (fallback should work)

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Suggested Enhancements
1. **Persistence:** Save last scan to localStorage
2. **History:** View past scans with timestamps
3. **Export:** Download results as PDF or Markdown
4. **Iterative refinement:** "Re-analyze" button to refine assessment
5. **Cross-project intelligence:** Detect conflicting assumptions across projects
6. **Portfolio recommendations:** "Focus on these 2 projects this week"
